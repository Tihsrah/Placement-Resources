  <li>Mentors</li>
  <li>Will ask you different technical aspects on your paper, testing you if you have thought about all scenarios with respect to the topic and 
your how did you apply your knowledge.</li>

        <li>Architecture of InceptionV3</li>
        <li>What are encoders and decoders?</li>
      <li>Few scenario based questions where you have to explain which machine learning algorithm will be best suited and why?</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Cloud/DevOps Concepts:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>What is Cloud and what is DevOps?</li>
        <li>Super Computers.</li>
        <li>What is virtualization, explain using a scenario.</li>
        <li>What is API?</li>
        <li>Docker concepts, basic Dockerfile structure explanation of its commands.</li>
        <li>What is serverless?</li>
        <li>Importance and need of serverless.</li>
        <li>REST API vs Web API.</li>
        <li>What services I have used in AWS, few questions regarding it.</li>
      <li>What is unit testing, load testing and stress testing?</li>
        <li> Basic about linux</li>
    </ul>
    <li>OOPS Concepts</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain 4 pillars of OOPS.</li>
        <li>Different types of constructors.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Python basics</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Is python interpreted or compiled</li>
      <li>What is PEP8?</li>
        <li>List v/s Tuple</li>
        <li>Immutable and mutable types</li>
        <li>How to make a variable private in Python?</li>
        <li>Difference between break, pass and continue, with examples.</li>
        <li>Array vs List</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
    <li>Coding Question: DP (coin sum combination)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Input: sum = 4, coins[] = {1,2,3}, </li>
        <li>Return(count) all combinations whose sum will be equal to targetSum</li>
        <li>There's an infinite supply of coins. Coins can be repeated.</li>
        <li>Output: 4</li>
      <li> First presented a recursive solution, then memoization. Then, they asked to further change the code to print all the combinations</li>
    </ul>

<h4>HR round:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Tell me about yourself</li>
    <li>Why do you want to join this company?</li>
    <li>Why not full stack developer and why data scientist? (Since I had an internship related to Javascript)</li>
    <li>Do you have any leadership experience?</li>
</ul>

## **Tips and Tricks:**

<ul>
    <li>Be confident.</li>
    <li>Don't lie on your resume and be honest throughout the interview, especially when they ask you to rate yourself. </li>
    <li>Be more practical with your explanations using technical references, instead of theoretical definitions.</li>
  <li>During the coding round, try to first explain it (visually if possible, using recursion tree, etc), then start writing the code.</li>
</ul>
